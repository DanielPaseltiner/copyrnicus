#### The Problem:
New students often take weeks to months to beging collecting good research-grade data using intracellular recordings.

### The Solution:
COPERNICUS is a platform for rapdily training students to both understand and perform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings.  It takes them every step of the way from checking their electrode to make a gigaseal and breaking in to the cell, to recording research-grade data and monitoring that data for quality issues.

### Features:
- It explains to students exactly what they are and should be doing at each step so that they learn the theory and practice concurrent with data acquisition.  
- It provides a series of intuitive monitors to prevent them from continuing data collection when the recording becomes unusable.
- It requires minimal mentorship, scaling to new graduate students, undergraduate students, or even high school students.
- It provides convenient setup of the entire experiment in advance by PIs, followable by trainees via a simple GUI.
- It provides reports and summaries for each recording, and for ensembles of recordings, allowing students and mentors to track progress.
- It gamifies patch clamp, engaging younger generations!
- The graphical and hardware-interface components are handled in Igor Pro, built on "Recording Artist" (used by over a dozen labs) ensuring compatibility with a broad spectrum of physiology hardware.
- The analysis and monitoring is handled concurrently in Python, allowing expansion to the broader scientific computing ecosystem.
